# FIR-group

FIR-group University of Sussex

Main aim: providing reading material and short code for new members. Each member of the group has their own folder with reading relevant to their work specifically. Extensive complete/working code should go to the [H-E-L-P](https://github.com/H-E-L-P) or AstroCast github.

The Slack chanel for the FIR group is sussex-fir.slack.com.

## Bayesian Inference

Some general reading recommended by Peter Hurley:

* Richard McElreath’s book is a great introduction for probabilisitic modelling, including Stan and PyMC example codes. http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/

* Andrew Gelman's Bayesian Data Analysis is a good general book.

* There are also some useful blogs, such as Thomas Wiecki's  https://twiecki.github.io/

## HELP

The Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project (HELP) basic pipeline consists of

* Masterlist production. See Shirley et al 2018 (Ask Raphael for draft)

* Photometric redshifts [Duncan et al 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09183).

* Cros IDentification plus (XID+) [Hurley et al 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05770).

* Code for Investigating Galaxy Emission (CIGALE) Spectral Energy Distirbution (SED) fitting [Małek et al (2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00529) 


## Example for individual member:

FIR astonomy, star forming galaxies in far infrared, look at: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.424.1614O

By going in the folder of an indiviudal group meber you should be able to see what the relevant reading material is for them. 

Look at Raphs folder for a good example!
