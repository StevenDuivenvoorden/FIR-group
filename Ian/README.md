FIR-group University of Sussex

#### HELP
- Working on incorporating radio data into HELP using Likelihood ratios.
- Rerun XID+ with crossmatched radio sources incorportaed into the prior list.
- Use this crossmatch to investigate the far infra-red radio correlation.

#### LOFAR
- Perform crossmatching in Lockman-SWIRE to panstarrs/UKIDS data for cross IDing in the deep LOFAR fields.
- assign deconvolved MIPS, PACS, SPIRE to these radio sources using XID+.
- FIRC work (same as above) and maybe extend to try and calibrate a radio SFR relation.
- Potentially investigate seperating AGN and SFG using a combination of criteria (eg MagPhys, CiGALE, AGNfitter etc)
