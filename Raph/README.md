# Raph's reading list
FIR-group University of Sussex

In this document I will list some of the basic texts for important topics in FIR astronomy as well as some papers that arte important for my work.

## Bayesian inference

Information theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms is a good introductory text. Some of the neural network sections may be getting out of date but a simple overview of how Bayesian inference works this is an excellent text book.

There are some good simple examples of ntoebooks at the GitHub page from a school in France here:

I would also recommend the School in general.

## Papers

1. Gruppioni et al (2013), The Herschel PEP/HerMES Luminosity Function â€“ I: Probing the Evolution of PACS selected Galaxies to z'4

Currently I am looking at the luminosity function of Gruppioni et al (2013)
